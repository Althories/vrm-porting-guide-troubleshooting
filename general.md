## This file contains troubleshooting fixes that aren't necessarily specific to any one program in the process.

Q1: The model I'm creating is for a different source engine game. What should I change in the process?

> A1: At the moment, that's not something I can answer. I'm not familiar enough with the source engine to have that general knowledge. However, I do have a version of this guide for L4D2 in my plans.

Q2: I can't upload my model to the Steam workshop: Items not allowed by whitelist

> A2: Make sure the filescructure of your folder is correct before attempting to upload - Crowbar will usually tell you what gets flagged. Someone made the mistake of having copies of materials and models in the wrong folders, so just be careful when you're reviewing
