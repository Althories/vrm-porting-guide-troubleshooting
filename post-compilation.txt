Troubleshooting for problems related to compilation results

Q1: My model compiled, but it's stuck in a T-pose!

A1: It's likely that the skeleton wasn't properly identified by Crowbar. You may have forgotten to rename the bones, insert the defineBone lines into your .qc file, or there was a misstep during proportion trick. Checking for the first two is easy,
but knowing whether you messed up in proportion trick can be tough to determine. If that might be the case, I would recommend re-exporting your model from new Blender and re-applying proportion trick.

Q2: When I apply my model in the playermodel selector, my model appears as an error.

A2: If you think everything else is right and your model looks normal in Crowbar's model viewer, you likely have a typo or incorrect directory in the .lua file. That, or one of the lines is commented out. True story!

Q3: My model is working in-game, but it uses this weird getup animation when landing on the ground.

A3: Remove the two instances of $includemodel "humans/female_shared.mdl" in your .qc file and recompile. This animation pack includes that animation, so removing the line will remove the animation.
