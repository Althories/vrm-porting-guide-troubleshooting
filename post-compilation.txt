Troubleshooting for problems related to compilation results

Q1: My model compiled, but it's stuck in a T-pose!

A1: It's likely that the skeleton wasn't properly identified by Crowbar. You may have forgotten to rename the bones, insert the defineBone lines into your .qc file, or there was a misstep during proportion trick. Checking for the first two is easy,
but knowing whether you messed up in proportion trick can be tough to determine. If that might be the case, I would recommend re-exporting your model from new Blender and re-applying proportion trick.
