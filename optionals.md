Q1: My model seems to have two sets of face flexes: one that moves and one that doesn't.

> A1: This can happen when combining the meshes together with CTRL + J, most likely if you made face flexes before combining the meshes. To avoid this, you can keep the affected parts separate, export the parts separately, and stitch them back together as bodygroups. You can also check for and delete duplicate face shapes after combining meshes.
