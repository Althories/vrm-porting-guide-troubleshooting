# vrm-porting-guide-troubleshooting
This repository is a collection of common errors, quirks, fixes, suggestions, etc. for the vrm-to-gmod port process. Contributions will be made to this repository if/when new problems arise and are fixed. If there is a fix you would like added to this repository, reach out to me through the Steam guide comments section or by email (Althories.bar@gmail.com)

This repository does not address any errors associated with the Crowbar compiler. Crowbar has its own documentation, and its error messages are generally pretty clear. That being said, each text file in this repository is meant to address different categories of the most common problems.

1. blender.txt contains troubleshooting fixes for the process in current Blender and Blender 2.79.
2. general.txt contains troubleshooting fixes that aren't necessarily specific to any one program in the process.
3. optionals.txt contains troubleshooting fixes related to the optional features of the guide.
4. post-compilation.txt contains troubleshooting fixes for problems after successful model compilation.
5. texturing.txt contains troubleshooting fixes for texturing issues.
