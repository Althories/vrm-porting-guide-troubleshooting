# vrm-porting-guide-troubleshooting
This repository is a collection of common errors, quirks, fixes, suggestions, etc. for the vrm-to-gmod port process. Click on any .md file to open and read its contents!

This repository does not cover every possible Crowbar compilation error, only those commonly encountered during the guide's modelmaking process. Crowbar has its own documentation, and its error messages are generally pretty clear. That being said, each text file in this repository is meant to address different categories of the most common problems. The main repository this repository serves to assist can be found here: https://github.com/Althories/vrm-porting-guide-files
