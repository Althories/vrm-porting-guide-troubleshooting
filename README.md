# vrm-porting-guide-troubleshooting
This repository is a collection of common errors, quirks, fixes, suggestions, etc. for the vrm-to-gmod port process. Contributions will be made to this repository if/when new problems arise and are fixed. If there is a fix you would like added to this repository, reach out to me through the Steam guide comments section or by email (Althories.bar@gmail.com)

This repository does not address any errors associated with the Crowbar compiler. Crowbar has its own documentation, and its error messages are generally pretty clear. That being said, each text file in this repository is meant to address different categories of the most common problems. The main repository this repository serves to assist can be found here: https://github.com/Althories/vrm-porting-guide-files
