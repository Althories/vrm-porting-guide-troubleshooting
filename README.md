# vrm-porting-guide-troubleshooting
This repository is a collection of common errors, quirks, fixes, suggestions, etc. for the vrm-to-gmod port process. Contributions will be made to this repository if/when new problems arise and are fixed.

This repository does not include any errors associated with Crowbar. That has its own documentation, and its error messages are generally pretty clear. That being said, each text file in this repository is meant to address different categories of the most common problems.

1. blender.txt contains troubleshooting fixes for the process in current Blender and Blender 2.79.

(This readme and repository is currently a work in progress. I'm just too lazy to private it right now.)
